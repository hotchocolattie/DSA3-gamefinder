*DSA Project 3 - Gamefinder!*
*By: Annalisa Folsom, Grace Zhao, Laurence Georges*

Once you're done playing an awesome game, you might think to yourself "I'd like more of this please!"
However, you might not know where to start.

Enter: GAMEFINDER!

Gamefinder can easily recommend top games to a user based off of aggregated rating results from a trusted source - IMBD. A user can easily search:
- The top 10 games of all time
- The top 10 games in a specific genre
- Information on a specific game

To run this program, just download the project folder, unzip the files, and open in CLion! The needed cmakefiles are already included for you to select!

Thank you for using GAMEFINDER!
